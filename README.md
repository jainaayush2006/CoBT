# CoBT: Collaborative Programming of Behaviour Trees from One Demonstration for Robot Manipulation

This repo includes demonstration data, segmented state variables and graphs, and generated BTs for all the 7 tasks discussed in the paper. Furthermore, it includes the responses from the conducted user study.

**Note**- 
* The demonstration data ([memory](Memory)) is in .pkl file format. To read the file refer to this [code](Memory/git_data.py). 
* In the segmented variables table ([here](Segmented_state_Variables)), red color text represents the effect conditions that are added to the BT, and blue color text represents the pre-conditions for the the next action.
