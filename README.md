# CoBT: Collaborative Programming of Behaviour Trees from One Demonstration for Robot Manipulation

This repo includes demonstration data, segmented state variables and graphs, and generated BTs for all the 7 tasks discussed in the paper. Furthermore, the responses from the conducted user study are [here](User-study_Responses).

:point_right: For performance evaluation, several trials were conducted for each task, where the target and goal objectâ€™s start pose are changed within **80cmx40cm** (typo in the paper) area on the table between trials.

**Note**- 
* The demonstration data ([memory](Memory)) is in .pkl file format. To read the file refer to this [code](Memory/reader.py). 
* In the segmented variables table ([here](Segmented_state_Variables)), red color text represents the effect conditions that are added to the BT, and blue color text represents the pre-conditions for the the next action.
* The codes for segmentation and BT generation will be released upon acceptance.
